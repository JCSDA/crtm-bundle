--- Building the CRTM  bundle ---

    cd /somewhere/to/store/source/code
    git clone https://github.com/JCSDA/crt,-bundle.git

    cd /somewhere/to/build
    ecbuild /somewhere/to/store/source/code/crtm-bundle
    make -j4

The ecbuild command above will clone all the source code for the projects defined in the
CMakeLists.txt in the bundle and the make command will build them all.

To work with a different branch than the default for a given project, the branch must be
modified in the CMakeLists.txt for the bundle.

Note: ecbuild accepts all cmake flags, for example, compilers can be selected with:
    ecbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/gcc-7.2/bin/g++ ${SRC}

For testing (from build directory):

    ctest

--- Working with the code ---

The CMakeLists.txt file in this directory contains the list of the repositories included
in the bundle and the branch to be used. The branch specified in the CMakeLists.txt is
the one that will be compiled. When working with you own branch, the should be changed in
the CMakeLists.txt file but it is not necessary to re-run ecbuild, make is enough.

After the fisrt build, changes in the code can be tested by re-running only
(from build directory):

    make -j4
    ctest

By default, make will not update your local repository from the remote. To update all repositories
in the bundle, run:

    make update

The update will fail for repositories that contain uncommited code. This is a safety mechanism to
avoid losing your work.

--- Note about using git ---

It is recommended that you create a .gitconfig file in your home directory (inside the container
if working from a container) with the following content:

$ cat .gitconfig 
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = yourname@somewhere.something

[credential]
    helper = cache --timeout=3600
