--- Building the JEDI  bundle ---

    cd /somewhere/to/store/source/code
    git clone https://github.com/UCAR/jedi-bundle.git

    cd /somewhere/to/build
    ecbuild /somewhere/to/store/source/code/jedi-bundle
    make -j4

The ecbuild command above will clone all the source code for the projects defined in the
CMakeLists.txt in the bundle and the make command will build them all.

To work with a different branch than the default for a given project, the branch must be
modified in the CMakeLists.txt for the bundle.

Note: ecbuild accepts all cmake flags, for example, compilers can be selected with:
    ecbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/gcc-7.2/bin/g++ ${SRC}

For testing (from build directory):

    ctest

--- Working with the code ---

After the fisrt build, changes in the code can be tested by re-running only
(from build directory):

    make -j4
    ctest
