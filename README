--- Building the JEDI  bundle ---

The variables ${SRC} and ${BUILD} below must be defined for your environement.
Note: It is good practice to build the code outside of the source tree.

The lines below can be copied into a script or executed manually:

    export SRC=/path/to/source
    export BUILD=/another/path/to/build

    export PATH=${PATH}:${SRC}/ecbuild/bin

    cp ./CMakeLists.txt ${SRC}
    rm -rf ${BUILD}; mkdir ${BUILD}; cd ${BUILD}

    ecbuild ${SRC}
    make -j4

Note: ecbuild accepts all cmake flags, for example, compilers can be selected with:
    ecbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/gcc-7.2/bin/g++ ${SRC}

For testing your build:

    cd ${BUILD}
    ctest

--- Working with the code ---

After the fisrt build, changes in the code can be tested by re-running only:

    cd ${BUILD}
    make -j4
    ctest
